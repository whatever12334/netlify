  <h1>üõ§Ô∏è The Poston Legacy: How My Family Gave a Name to a South Carolina Town</h1>

  <p>Few things feel more grounding than standing on land your ancestors once claimed from the wilderness. For me, that land is <strong>Poston, South Carolina</strong> ‚Äî a small, unincorporated community in Florence County that carries my family‚Äôs name. This isn‚Äôt just coincidence. It‚Äôs bloodline.</p>

  <h2>A Family Rooted in South Carolina Soil</h2>
  <p>The name \"Poston\" has appeared in the region for centuries. My direct ancestor <strong>Andrew Poston (1829‚Äì1916)</strong>, the son of <strong>Hugh Poston (1797‚Äì1865)</strong>, is recognized as the founder of the town of Poston. This connection was documented as far back as 1936 in the <em>Columbia Record</em>, and reinforced in the 1965 genealogy volume <em>A Poston Family of South Carolina</em> by Erma Poston Landers.</p>

  <p>Andrew, like many in the Poston line, was a landowner who understood the Pee Dee River‚Äôs value for agriculture and trade. The town that bears our name once stood as a hub of rural activity, and although it‚Äôs now considered unincorporated, its name remains on the map ‚Äî and in the soil.</p>

  <h2>From Founders to Storytellers</h2>
  <p>That same Poston spirit has carried on through generations. My great-grandfather <strong>Lawrence Chalmers Poston (1886‚Äì1930)</strong> and my father <strong>Harold Chalmers Poston Jr.</strong> (b. 1954) maintained deep ties to South Carolina‚Äôs landscape and people. Today, my brother and I continue that legacy ‚Äî not through land deeds, but through <strong>law, music, and conservation</strong>.</p>

  <p>We established <strong>The Poston Preserve</strong> in Manning, SC, as a private outdoor mentorship property to reconnect youth with nature and heritage. It serves as living proof that the Poston legacy isn‚Äôt a relic ‚Äî it‚Äôs active, rooted, and growing.</p>

  <h2>The Documentation That Connects It All</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><em>The Columbia Record</em> (1936): Andrew Poston founded Poston, SC</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.seekingmyroots.com/members/files/G005121.pdf" target="_blank">A Poston Family of South Carolina</a> (1965): Genealogy by Erma Poston Landers</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83238860/andrew-poston" target="_blank">Find a Grave ‚Äì Andrew Poston</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Poston-449" target="_blank">WikiTree ‚Äì Andrew Poston</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>Names matter. History matters. If we don't preserve the stories of where we come from, those stories get overwritten or lost.</p>

  <p><strong>Poston is more than a sign on the side of the road ‚Äî it's our family‚Äôs stamp on the geography of the South.</strong></p>
