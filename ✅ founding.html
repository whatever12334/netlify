  <h1>🛤️ The Poston Legacy: How My Family Gave a Name to a South Carolina Town</h1>

  <p>Few things feel more grounding than standing on land your ancestors once claimed from the wilderness. For me, that land is <strong>Poston, South Carolina</strong> — a small, unincorporated community in Florence County that carries my family’s name. This isn’t just coincidence. It’s bloodline.</p>

  <h2>A Family Rooted in South Carolina Soil</h2>
  <p>The name "Poston" has appeared in the region for centuries. My direct ancestor <strong>Andrew Poston (1829–1916)</strong>, the son of <strong>Hugh Poston (1797–1865)</strong>, is recognized as the founder of the town of Poston.</p>

  <p>Andrew, like many in the Poston line, was a landowner who understood the Pee Dee River’s value for agriculture and trade. Although it’s now considered unincorporated, the town still bears our name — and our legacy.</p>

  <h2>Poston Family Tree</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hugh Poston</strong> (1797–1865)</li>
    <li><strong>Andrew Poston</strong> (1829–1916)</li>
    <li><strong>Lawrence Chalmers Poston</strong> (1886–1930)</li>
    <li><strong>Harold Chalmers Poston</strong> (1919–1977)</li>
    <li><strong>Harold Chalmers Poston Jr.</strong> (b. 1954)</li>
    <li><strong>Eric Chalmers Poston</strong> (b. 1987)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This lineage is documented in the 1965 publication <em>A Poston Family of South Carolina</em> by Erma Poston Landers.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p><strong>Poston isn’t just a location. It’s a living legacy. It’s a name that stands for tradition, responsibility, and renewal.</strong></p>
