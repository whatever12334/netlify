  <h1>ðŸŒ² In Memory of Fleetwood Moody: The Man Who Taught Us the Land Could Speak</h1>

  <p>Some people teach with words.<br>
  <strong>Fleetwood Moody taught with silence.</strong></p>

  <p>He didnâ€™t need to say muchâ€”just being in the woods with him, you knew you were in the presence of someone who understood the land in a way most people never would. He walked slowly, listened closely, and treated every inch of The Poston Preserve with reverence.</p>

  <p>For our family, he was more than a hunter or a steward. He was our compass. Our quiet protector. The man who taught us to stop, breathe, and respect the ground beneath our feet.</p>

  <p>When we opened The Poston Preserve to othersâ€”especially underprivileged youth and familiesâ€”we did it with Fleetwoodâ€™s spirit in mind. He believed every child should know how it feels to track a deer trail at dawn, to cast a line into still water, or to simply sit beneath a canopy of trees and feel <em>free</em>.</p>

  <p>Fleetwood Moody didnâ€™t want praise. He wanted peace. And that's exactly what The Poston Preserve offers in his honor: a peaceful refuge, a space to heal, to grow, and to reconnect with something bigger than ourselves.</p>

  <p>We miss him every day, but his presence is everywhere hereâ€”in the stillness, in the dirt, in the next kid we welcome to the woods for the first time.</p>

  <p><strong>This land remembers. And so do we.</strong></p>
